MERN is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).


1. MongoDB:

-MongoDB is an open source, cross platform, NoSql DBMS.
-It is a document oriented database, which means that data is saved using collections and documents, instead of tables and rows, like in a relational database. This makes possible easier and faster data integration within applications.
-MongoDB stores the data in binary JSON format that allows the fast exchange of data between client and server.
-MongoDB can be used for the storage of large volumes of data, which makes it highly scalable.


2. Express JS:

-Express JS is a modular, lightweight framework of the Node JS, that helps in building web applications.
-It is a server side, back-end, JavaScript based framework, that is designed to write simplified, fast and secure applications.
-It can be assumed that Express JS, runs on top of the Node JS, managing the server and its routes.

3. React JS:

-React JS is an open source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, typically for single page applications.
-React JS enables developers to modify/edit and refresh the page to view the changes without having to restart or reload the page.
-React JS offers the facility of code reusability on multiple platforms.
-It is fast and scalable.

4. Node JS:

-Node JS is an open-source, cross platform, JavaScript runtime environment.
-It is designed to run the JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server side.
-Node JS accesses the Node Package Manager (NPM), that hosts a large number of private and public packages, and is as well utilized for publishing Node JS projects.
-It is based on the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
